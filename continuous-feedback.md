• design processes to capture and analyze user feedback from external sources (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, Help Desk)
• design routing for client application crash report data
• recommend monitoring tools and technologies
• recommend system and feature usage tracking tools

Implement process for routing system feedback to development teams
• configure crash report integration for client applications
• develop monitoring and status dashboards
• implement routing for client application crash report data
• implement tools to track system usage, feature usage, and flow
• integrate and configure ticketing systems with development team's work management
system (e.g., IT Service Management connector, ServiceNow Cloud Management, App
