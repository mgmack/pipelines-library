Implement dependency management
Design a dependency management strategy
• recommend artifact management tools and practices (Azure Artifacts, npm, Maven,
Nuget)
• abstract common packages to enable sharing and reuse
• inspect codebase to identify code dependencies that can be converted to packages
• identify and recommend standardized package types and versions across the solution
• refactor existing build pipelines to implement version strategy that publishes packages
