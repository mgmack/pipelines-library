# pipelines-library
This library contains emplates and code for reuse across Azure Devops projects.

Library includes .yml files, JSON, Angular 8 and .NETCore code, JS/NodeJS, Powershell and Bash scripts

Why CI/CD and Azure Pipelines?
Implementing CI and CD pipelines helps to ensure consistent and quality code that's readily available to users.
Azure Pipelines is a quick, easy, and safe way to automate building your projects and making them available to users.

Use CI (Build) and CD (Release) for projects
- Continuous integration is used to automate tests and builds for your project.
- CI helps to catch bugs or issues early in the development cycle, when they're easier and faster to fix.
- Items known as artifacts are produced from CI systems. They're used by the continuous delivery release pipelines
  to drive automatic deployments.
- Continuous delivery is used to automatically deploy and test code in multiple stages to help drive quality.
- Continuous integration systems produce deployable artifacts, which includes infrastructure and apps. Automated
  release pipelines consume these artifacts to release new versions and fixes to the target of your choice

Continuous integration (CI)
- Increase code coverage.
- Build faster by splitting test and build runs.
- Automatically ensure you don't ship broken code.
- Run tests continually.

Continuous delivery (CD)
- Automatically deploy code to production.
- Ensure deployment targets have latest code.
- Use tested code from CI process.
